						<p> My thesis path takes off from an incident that happened a few months ago now.I happened to be in a supermarket with my niece doing her shopping and she made a request very common to all children: auntie I want a chocolate egg. So in front of the egg shelf we stood there for 15 minutes. I wanted to buy her the egg that I knew from fondness of the brand, from experience, that it tasted better, while she wanted the chocolate egg that depicted one of her favorite characters and was more colorful and yet I had a lower quality. There was no way I could convince her to get the one I was going to get. On the way back I stopped for a second and felt a great responsibility to what had happened. I thought about how important it is to communicate in the right way to children, I thought about how important it is to know how to communicate to children, since they are not brand loyal and maybe, as in the case of my niece, they can't read, everything to them communicates. And I wondered: how do we communicate to children? How do children interpret the packaging in front of them? Based on what do they ask for one product instead of another? Then thinking that in 90 percent of cases it is the parents who buy, I wondered: what about the parents? Do they have the background to understand what is best for their children and what is not? That day in front of that shelf I really felt a strong responsibility since communication is really about me and so I decided to get to work, trying to figure out first of all who needed to be worked on.
So it was from these questions that the research work began, leading to the creation of a platform aimed at parents in order to help them make a conscious choice of food for their children.
